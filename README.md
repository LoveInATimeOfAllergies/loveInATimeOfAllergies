# Love in a Time of Allergies 

## Overview

Group project assigned during Juno College of Technology's Web Development Bootcamp. A project brief with the app concept, style guide, and technical requirements was provided to assigned groups. This app allows a user to create and save dinner parties to a Firebase database, assign guests with dietary restrictions to the dinner party, and fetch data from a RESTFUL API to source 20 recipes that adhere to the dietary restrictions of the entire group. The app was designed by Daniela Parra, Gogulan Ravichandran, Leo Hon and Lucas Pasqualoni.
